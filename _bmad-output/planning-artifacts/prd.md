# Product Requirements Document - ROI Calculator

**Author:** JB
**Date:** 2026-02-03

## Executive Summary

The ARGOS ROI Calculator V10 transforms how Pfeiffer Vacuum demonstrates predictive maintenance value to semiconductor clients. Moving from a generic trade-show pitch tool (V9) to a live sales engineering platform, V10 enables real-time ROI calculation using customers' actual operational data during meetings.

**Core Differentiator:** Live co-construction of process-specific ROI analyses using sensitive client data shared verbally during meetings — data that is never available in writing and is lost if not captured in real-time.

**Target Users:**
- **Marc Dubois (Sub Fab Manager - Client-side):** Manages 1,000+ vacuum pumps. Needs concrete ROI numbers to defend ARGOS investment internally with management and procurement.
- **JB Cholat (Product Marketing - Pfeiffer-side):** Captures live verbal data, co-creates credible business cases, exports professional PDF reports before leaving client meetings.
- **Regional Sales Colleagues (Pfeiffer-side):** Replicate JB's workflow after training in Germany, Asia, and other territories.

**Business Urgency:** Three concrete opportunities (GF Dresden, ST Rousset, NXP) are advancing to deep analysis phase. ARGOS pricing has surprised clients — without demonstrating value on *their* numbers, the offer appears prohibitive. V10 must be operational for Q1 2026 client meetings.

**Product Vision:** V10 (ROI Calculator) + V11 (Solutions Module) collapse the traditional 6-8 week semiconductor sales cycle into a single live session (90-120 minutes): ROI justification → Technical scoping → Professional PDF export → Client becomes internal champion.

## Success Criteria

### User Success

**For Marc Dubois (Sub Fab Manager - Client-side):**

**Outcome-Based Success:**
1. **Can defend pilot with conditional PO internally**
   - Has concrete numbers to present to management AND procurement
   - PDF report withstands scrutiny from finance/purchasing teams
   - Can justify ARGOS investment on most impactful tools (not all pumps)

2. **Engages in price negotiation with confidence**
   - Understands ROI tradeoffs ("If we reduce scope to 2 processes instead of 3, how does ROI change?")
   - Can challenge assumptions and improve reasoning during live session
   - Sees tradeoffs transparently during negotiation

3. **Becomes internal champion**
   - Shares PDF report within 48 hours to multiple stakeholders (management, procurement, quality teams)
   - Requests follow-up meeting to analyze additional processes
   - Advocates for pilot approval in internal decision meetings

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- **Early engagement**: Shares real failure data verbally during first meeting (vs. holding back)
- **Active collaboration**: Asks "what if" questions to test scenarios
- **Post-meeting action**: Forwards PDF internally within 2 business days

**For JB Cholat (Product Marketing - Pfeiffer-side):**

**Outcome-Based Success:**
1. **Captures all sensitive data live during meeting**
   - Zero "let me get back to you with analysis" moments
   - Processes verbal client data in real-time without post-meeting calculations

2. **Co-creates credible business case**
   - Exports PDF report before leaving meeting
   - Report quality sufficient for client to share with procurement/management without edits

3. **Negotiates pricing with data-driven flexibility**
   - Can adjust ARGOS detection rate, service cost, or scope live to find acceptable ROI threshold
   - Client sees tradeoffs transparently during negotiation

4. **Establishes replicable workflow**
   - Can train regional colleagues (Germany, Asia) to replicate success

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- **High engagement**: Creates 3+ process analyses per client meeting (vs. 1 generic pitch)
- **Export rate**: 90%+ of meetings result in PDF export
- **Follow-up success**: Client responds to post-meeting email within 7 days with next steps

---

### Business Success

**Q1 2026 (Immediate Focus):**

1. **Validate V10 workflow in live client settings**
   - Confirm that live co-construction creates stronger client commitment than post-meeting analysis
   - Gather client feedback to refine calculator assumptions

2. **Convert opportunities to pilots with conditional POs** *(Business outcome - not solely product-dependent)*
   - GF Dresden: Pilot on critical etch tools with conditional PO for 50+ pumps
   - ST Rousset: Pilot on bottleneck processes with conditional PO for 30+ pumps
   - NXP: Pilot on batch tools with conditional PO for 40+ pumps
   - **Note**: Conditional PO success depends on multiple factors (pricing, client budget, timing) beyond V10 product quality

3. **Establish replicable sales playbook**
   - Document workflow for regional colleagues (Germany, Asia) to replicate success
   - Create training materials for V10 usage in client meetings

**2026 Full Year (Strategic Goals):**

1. **Reduce time-to-pilot from 6+ months to <90 days**
   - Current: Trade-show pitch → multiple meetings → manual analysis → pilot discussion → 6+ months
   - Target: Trade-show pitch → 1-2 V10 co-construction sessions → conditional PO → <90 days

2. **Scale beyond JB's direct involvement**
   - Regional colleagues successfully use V10 to close 2+ additional pilots

3. **Differentiate ARGOS in competitive landscape**
   - Sub Fab Managers reference "Pfeiffer's ROI calculator" as unique value in vendor comparisons

## Product Scope

### MVP Strategy & Philosophy

**MVP Approach:** Experience MVP

V10 + V11 creates a **delightful live co-construction experience** that transforms client perception from "vendor pitch" to "collaborative workspace." The MVP prioritizes workflow fluidity and engagement quality over feature completeness.

**Strategic Rationale:**
- Not just "it works" — but "it's a better experience than PowerPoint + email"
- End-to-end session — ROI → Solutions → Unified PDF in one meeting (90-120 minutes)
- Psychological shift — Client stops viewing it as sales pitch, starts viewing it as their business case

**MVP Scope:** V10 + V11 together (parallel development, Q1 2026 launch)

**Resource Requirements:**
- **1 Frontend Developer** (React/Vue, JavaScript, SPA architecture)
- **0.5 UX Designer** (multi-analysis navigation pattern, PDF template design)
- **JB (Product Owner)**: Requirements validation, internal testing, first client sessions
- **Optional**: 0.5 Backend Developer (if PDF generation library integration is complex)

**Timeline:**
- **V10 Development**: 6-8 weeks
- **V11 Development**: 4-6 weeks (parallel or sequential after V10 core)
- **Internal Validation**: 2 weeks (~15 days before first client session)
- **First Client Sessions**: Q1 2026 (GF Dresden, ST Rousset, NXP)

- Interactive charts (bar charts, pie charts)

---

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Technical Risks:**

| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **PDF generation too slow** (<3s target) | Pre-compiled templates, optimized rendering, minimal dependencies | "Email PDF in 30 seconds" fallback |
| **Multi-analysis navigation UX unclear** | UX design iteration before dev, user testing with JB | Start with simple list+detail view, iterate post-launch |
| **Solutions architecture diagram complexity** | Pre-built SVG templates, not dynamic generation | Static diagram in PDF if interactive too complex |
| **Browser compatibility** (Chrome versions) | Test on latest 2-3 Chrome stable versions | Document minimum Chrome version |

**Market Risks:**

| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Clients won't share sensitive data live** | Emphasize client-side processing, no cloud storage. Test with GF Dresden first | "Hypothetical data" mode if clients hesitate |
| **Live session feels rushed/pressured** | Internal rehearsal ~15 days before launch. Conversational pace | Allow mid-session save, resume later |
| **PDF not credible for internal sharing** | Expert review before launch, Pfeiffer branding, methodology section | JB manually edits PDF post-export (short-term) |
| **Solutions module adoption <70%** | Monitor usage in first 10 sessions, gather feedback | Make Solutions optional, don't force adoption |
| **Innovation doesn't translate to POs** | Decouple product metrics from business metrics. Focus on leading indicators | Investigate external blockers (pricing, timing) |

**Resource Risks:**

| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Development slower than expected** | Prioritize V10 over V11 if timeline slips | Launch V10 only in Q1, add V11 in Phase 2 |
| **Limited developer resources** | Proven tech stack (React/Vue, jsPDF), minimize custom code | Hire contractor for PDF generation module |
| **JB unavailable for validation** | Document validation criteria upfront, delegate to sales engineers | Regional colleagues validate in parallel |

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Marc Dubois — Sub Fab Manager (Client-side, Primary User)

**Persona:**
Marc Dubois, Sub Fab Manager at a major semiconductor fab (e.g., ST Rousset). Manages 1,000+ vacuum pumps with a team of 5-20 technicians. His primary KPI is equipment uptime — one pump failure means clean room production stops. He's under constant pressure from plant directors to maintain zero failures on critical tools while working within a fixed maintenance budget.

**Current Pain:**
Marc recently experienced a costly incident: 5 pump crashes led to 5 batches of scrapped wafers, resulting in several hundred thousand euros lost. His current workaround is aggressive preventive maintenance (reducing cycles from 24 months → 18 months → 12 months), which is expensive but feels like the only reliable option. He lives with permanent stress on critical tools and struggles to justify preventive investments with fuzzy ROI numbers.

**Opening Scene: Discovery**
JB requests a meeting to discuss "predictive maintenance ROI analysis." Marc is skeptical but curious because recent incidents are still fresh. The meeting invitation mentions "analyzing your specific processes with your actual data," which catches his attention.

**Rising Action: Live Co-Construction**
The meeting starts. JB opens V10 on his laptop. Instead of a PowerPoint pitch, JB asks: "Let's analyze one of your critical processes. Which tool has the highest stakes?"

Marc responds: "Our poly etch Chamber 04 — runs 125-wafer batches, €8k per wafer. We had 3 pump failures last year."

JB clicks **"New Analysis"**. Marc sees his process name appear on screen: **"Poly Etch — Chamber 04"**.

JB fills inputs as Marc verbally shares data he'd never put in an email:
- Pump model: A3004XN
- Quantity: 8 pumps
- Failure rate: 3 pump failures last year
- Wafer cost: €8,000
- Downtime per failure: 6 hours
- Downtime cost: €15,000/hour

Results appear **instantly**:
- **€2.1M annual failure risk**
- **ARGOS service cost: €20k/year**
- **Savings: €1.4M**
- **ROI: 180%**

**Climax: The "Aha!" Moment**
Marc pauses. *"Wait, that's based on MY numbers?"*

For the first time, he sees ROI calculated on his actual operational data — not generic industry averages. This isn't a vendor pitch; it's his business case taking shape in real-time.

Marc leans forward: *"Can we check our metal deposition tools too?"*

**Multi-Process Analysis:**
JB clicks **"New Analysis"** again. They repeat the workflow for 2 more critical processes. The **Global Analysis** view updates:
- **€3.8M total savings across 3 critical tool groups**
- **Overall ROI: 165%**

Marc asks "what if" questions — adjusting scope and detection rates. JB modifies parameters live. Marc sees tradeoffs transparently. He's co-constructing his own business case.

**Resolution: Export & Internal Pitch**
JB clicks **"Export PDF"**. A professional report generates within seconds. Marc receives it via email before JB leaves.

Within 48 hours, Marc forwards the PDF to three stakeholders:
1. **Fab Director** — "Can we discuss pilot approval?"
2. **Procurement Manager** — "Let's negotiate scope."
3. **Quality Team Lead** — "This could prevent incidents like last quarter."

Marc requests a follow-up meeting to analyze 2 additional processes. He's become an internal champion — not from a sales pitch, but because he co-created his own business case.

---

### Journey 2: JB Cholat — Product Marketing / Service Leadership (Pfeiffer-side, Primary User)

**Persona:**
JB Cholat, Product Marketing & Service Leadership for ARGOS Platform. Handling 3 opportunities (GF Dresden, ST Rousset, NXP) transitioning from trade-show pitches to deep analysis phase. Challenge: Convert pricing-surprised prospects into pilots.

**Current Pain:**
V9 can't handle granular, process-specific client data. When clients share sensitive information verbally, there's no mechanism to process it live. JB says "Let me get back to you with a feasibility study," killing momentum. By the next meeting, the window has closed.

**Pre-Meeting Prep:**
JB reviews client context, opens V10, confirms Global Parameters (detection rate: 70%, service cost: €2,500/year).

**During Client Meeting:**
JB transitions to co-construction: *"Marc, let's analyze one of your critical processes together."*

Marc shares data. JB creates a **New Analysis** and fills inputs as Marc speaks — no note-taking, no "let me get back to you." Results appear immediately: **€2.1M failure risk, €1.4M savings, 180% ROI**.

Marc challenges: *"What if wafer cost is €10k instead of €8k?"* JB adjusts live. ROI recalculates: **€4.2M savings**. Marc sees sensitivity analysis in real-time.

**The Co-Creation Moment:**
Marc asks to export. JB clicks **"Export PDF"**. Within 3 seconds, a professional report generates. JB emails it before leaving — walking out with a co-created business case Marc will champion internally.

**Resolution:**
One week later, Marc responds: *"Management and procurement want to discuss pilot terms."*

Three weeks later, ST Rousset signs a **conditional PO** for 30 pumps. JB repeats with GF Dresden and NXP. By end of Q1 2026, all 3 opportunities advance to pilot discussions. JB documents the workflow in a **Sales Playbook** for regional colleagues.

---

### Journey 3: Regional Sales Colleague (Pfeiffer-side, Secondary User)

**Persona:**
Regional sales colleague (Germany or Asia). Has technical sales experience but hasn't used V10 yet.

**Training with JB:**
After JB validates V10 with 2-3 clients, he trains regional colleagues on the workflow:
1. **New Analysis** → Name with client process
2. **Input Panel** → Fill as client shares data verbally
3. **Instant Calculation** → Show ROI live
4. **Global Analysis** → Aggregate multiple processes
5. **Export PDF** → Professional report

Tips: Don't rush inputs. Adjust parameters live when clients ask "what if." Export PDF before leaving.

**First Solo Client Meeting:**
Two weeks later, the colleague meets a client in Germany. They follow JB's workflow. Client shares dry etch data. Results: **€1.8M savings, ROI 150%**. Client asks to analyze 2 more processes. **Global Analysis** shows **€4.1M savings**. Client challenges detection rate — colleague adjusts live.

**Resolution:**
Colleague exports PDF, emails it. One week later, client requests follow-up. By end of 2026, regional colleagues have closed 2+ additional pilots, demonstrating V10's scalability beyond JB.

---

### Journey 4: Fab Director / Procurement Manager (Client-side, PDF Review Journey)

**Persona:**
**Fab Director:** Approves budgets, evaluates ROI credibility.
**Procurement Manager:** Evaluates pricing, negotiates terms.

**PDF Received:**
Marc forwards V10 PDF: *"ROI analysis based on our actual operational data. Worth piloting on critical equipment."*

**Document Analysis:**
Fab Director sees specific process names, matching wafer costs, aligned downtime rates. *This isn't generic.*

Procurement Manager challenges: *"Is 70% detection rate realistic? Can we pilot fewer pumps?"*

**Internal Discussion:**
Marc confirms data was co-created during the Pfeiffer meeting using real numbers.

**Resolution:**
Fab Director approves pilot contingent on: negotiated terms, 2 processes first, conditional PO structure. Two weeks later, **conditional PO signed** for 30 pumps across 2 critical processes. The PDF was the key artifact enabling internal defense of the investment.

---

### Journey 5: Internal Validation Team (Pfeiffer-side, Pre-Launch Journey)

**Persona:**
Cross-functional Pfeiffer team: Sales Engineers, Service Leadership, Product Marketing, Finance/Pricing. JB facilitates.

**Pre-Launch Review (~15 days before GF Dresden):**

**Session 1 — Formula Review:**
- Failure cost formula validated: `(failures × wafer cost × wafers) + (failures × downtime hours × cost/hour)`
- ARGOS Savings formula: `failure cost × detection rate − service cost`
- Dual-mode failure rate input confirmed
- Global Parameters (detection rate, service cost) adjustable

**Session 2 — Assumptions & Edge Cases:**
- Default service cost (€2,500/pump/year) confirmed, editable for specialty models
- Assumptions section added to PDF template for transparency
- Large-scale analyses tested (50 pumps) — calculations scale correctly

**Session 3 — Workflow Rehearsal:**
Full end-to-end workflow tested. UX feedback noted (tooltips, comparison table, button placement).

**Consensus:**
- ✅ ROI formulas mathematically correct
- ✅ Default parameters sensible with editability
- ✅ PDF export professional and credible
- ✅ Workflow intuitive for live client use
- ✅ Edge cases handled

V10 marked **validated and ready for GF Dresden meeting**.

## Innovation & Novel Patterns

### Detected Innovation Areas

**1. Live End-to-End Session — Collapsing the Sales Cycle**

Traditional semiconductor equipment sales: PowerPoint pitch → "Let me get back to you" → 1-2 weeks manual analysis → another meeting → technical scoping → proposal → **6-8 weeks minimum**.

V10 + V11 collapses this into a **single live session** (90-120 minutes):
1. **Phase 1 (V10):** Live ROI co-construction with verbal data → Instant PDF
2. **Phase 2 (V11):** Seamless transition → Technical deployment co-creation → Unified PDF
3. **Phase 3 (Future):** Potential conditional PO draft generation

**2. Real-Time Sensitive Data Capture in Critical Window**

Semiconductor clients share sensitive operational data (failure rates, wafer costs) **only verbally during meetings** — never in writing. V10 is designed around this **critical capture window**. If data isn't processed live, it's lost forever.

**Novel Aspect:** Most sales tools assume data can be captured post-meeting. V10 recognizes that for sensitive B2B data, **the meeting is the only window**.

**3. Process-Level Granularity + Live Co-Construction**

Competitor tools use generic ROI calculators with fixed categories (e.g., "Regular Tools 60%, Bottleneck Tools 20%"). V10 combines **process-level granularity** (analyses named with actual client processes) with **live co-construction** (calculations happen as client speaks). This creates a **psychological shift**: from "vendor pitch" to "my business case being built in real-time."

**Novel Interaction Pattern:** Sales tool as collaborative workspace, not presentation medium.

---

### Market Context & Competitive Landscape

- Most vendors use static PowerPoint presentations with generic ROI claims
- Post-meeting manual analysis is standard (weeks turnaround)
- One competitor has an online ROI calculator, but generic (no process-specific granularity)

**V10 + V11 Differentiation:**
- **Speed**: 6-8 weeks → 1 session
- **Granularity**: Generic categories → Process-specific analyses
- **Data Capture**: Post-meeting → Real-time during critical window
- **Output**: PowerPoint → Professional PDF with ROI + Technical Specs

**Strategic Position:** If no competitor offers live, end-to-end session capability with process-level granularity, this creates a **defensible competitive moat** (12-24 months before replication).

---

### Validation Approach

**V10 Validation (Q1 2026):**
1. **Workflow Adoption**: Do clients share sensitive data during live sessions? (Target: >90% PDF export rate)
2. **Engagement Quality**: Do clients ask "what if" questions? (Indicator: engaged, not passive)
3. **Internal Champion Behavior**: Do Sub Fab Managers forward PDF within 48 hours?

**V11 Validation (H1 2026):**
1. **Solutions Adoption**: >70% click "Solutions" button after ROI phase
2. **Time-to-Proposal**: 7-14 days → <48 hours
3. **PDF Comprehensiveness**: Can clients start pilot scoping from unified PDF alone?

**Failure Signals:**
- <50% PDF export rate → Workflow doesn't fit real usage
- <50% Solutions adoption → Module doesn't add value
- Zero conditional POs in Q1 → Investigate external factors (pricing, timing)

---

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Application Architecture

**Architecture Pattern:** Tab-based Single Page Application (SPA)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **SPA with Tab Navigation**: Two primary tabs (Analyses, Solutions) with seamless switching
- **State Persistence**: All session data persists in memory during meeting
- **Client-Side Processing**: ROI calculations and PDF generation — no backend for MVP
- **Local PDF Generation**: No cloud storage or external processing

**Navigation Structure:**
- **Tab 1 — "Analyses" (V10):** Multi-analysis management, input panel, real-time ROI, Global Analysis, Export PDF and Solutions buttons
- **Tab 2 — "Solutions" (V11):** Technical deployment configuration, pre-filled context, architecture visualization, unified PDF export

**State Management:**
- Session state persists in memory across tab navigation
- No server-side persistence for MVP
- Local storage optional for crash recovery

**Navigation Flow:**
- Users can switch freely between tabs without data loss
- "Solutions" button in Global Analysis auto-navigates to Tab 2
- Tab state indicators show completion status

---

### Multi-Analysis Management

Supporting 2-5 analyses per session requires thoughtful UI to avoid screen clutter, excessive scrolling, and cognitive overload.

**Requirements:**
- Easy navigation between analyses
- Clear active state indicator
- Quick comparison in Global Analysis view

**Potential Patterns (deferred to UX Design):** Cards layout, List + Detail view, Accordion, Sub-tabs

---

### Browser, Responsiveness & Accessibility

**Browser:** Chrome only (latest stable version). Multi-browser deferred to V12+.

**Screen Targets:** Laptop screens (13"-15", 1920x1080 or 1366x768). Minimum width ~1200px. Sidebar collapses below 1400px. Mobile/tablet deferred to V12+.

**Accessibility:** Basic — keyboard navigation, form labels, focus indicators, logical tab order. WCAG 2.1 AA deferred to V12+.

**SEO:** Not required (internal sales tool, direct URL access).

---

### Data Persistence & Storage

**MVP:** Client-side only. Session data in browser memory, cleared on page close. No backend, no database, no cloud sync. PDF export serves as permanent record.

**Rationale:** Client data sensitivity — clients won't share operational data if stored in cloud. Client-side only = trust-building strategy.

**Optional:** User-triggered local storage save for crash recovery.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- **NFR-P1**: ROI calculation updates complete within 100ms of input change
- **NFR-P2**: PDF generation (V10 only) completes within 3 seconds
- **NFR-P3**: PDF generation (V10+V11 unified) completes within 5 seconds
- **NFR-P4**: Navigation between Analyses and Solutions views completes within 200ms
  - **Measurement**: Browser Performance API (performance.mark) from click event to DOM ready state, averaged over 20 transitions
  - **Context**: Nielsen's 0.1s perceptibility threshold — 200ms feels instant to users, maintaining flow during live co-construction
- **NFR-P5**: Initial page load completes within 2 seconds on standard broadband (10 Mbps+)
- **NFR-P6**: System maintains performance with 5 concurrent analyses
  - **Metric**: Calculation latency remains <100ms (same as NFR-P1) with 5 analyses loaded
  - **Measurement**: Load 5 analyses with complex inputs; measure calculation update time using Performance API; latency must remain <100ms
  - **Context**: Typical session = 3 analyses; 5 = edge case for high-engagement meetings

### Security

- **NFR-S1**: Client operational data (failure rates, wafer costs, downtime) is NOT transmitted to external servers
- **NFR-S2**: Session data uses ephemeral storage and is automatically cleared when session ends
- **NFR-S3**: PDF exports are generated client-side without cloud processing
- **NFR-S4**: Application is served over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- **NFR-S5**: No authentication required for MVP (internal tool, deployed on internal Pfeiffer network or accessible URL)

### Reliability

- **NFR-R1**: Core workflow completes without blocking failures
  - **Metric**: 0 bugs that prevent completion of: New Analysis → Input → Calculate → Global Analysis → PDF Export
  - **Measurement**: Execute 20 end-to-end test scenarios covering typical inputs, edge cases (0 pumps, missing fields), and 5-analysis sessions. Success = 100% PDF export completion.
  - **Context**: Single critical bug kills live meeting momentum — Sub Fab Managers cannot wait for fixes
  - **Definition of "Critical Bug"**: Any error that prevents PDF export or causes data loss (crashes, calculation errors, validation blocking valid inputs)
- **NFR-R2**: PDF export success rate >99% (failure rate <1%)
- **NFR-R3**: PDF generation failures display clear recovery path
  - **Metric**: On PDF failure, system displays: (1) error message explaining issue, (2) retry button, (3) option to save session data
  - **Measurement**: Simulate PDF generation failure (e.g., mock library error); verify error message displays, retry button functions, and session data persists
  - **Context**: If PDF fails in live meeting, JB needs immediate recovery — not application crash
- **NFR-R4**: System validates all inputs before calculation to prevent runtime errors
- **NFR-R5**: Application remains functional after 2+ hours of continuous use (typical client meeting duration)
