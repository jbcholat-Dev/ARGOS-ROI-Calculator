# Epic 2 Retrospective - Single Analysis Creation & ROI Calculation

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Epic:** Epic 2 - Single Analysis Creation & ROI Calculation
**Status:** COMPLETED (8/8 stories)
**Participants:** JB (Project Lead), Bob (Scrum Master), Alice (Product Owner), Charlie (Senior Dev), Dana (QA Engineer), Elena (Junior Dev)

---

## Executive Summary

Epic 2 successfully delivered the Minimum Viable Analysis (MVA) for the ARGOS ROI Calculator V10. All 8 stories completed with approximately 412 new tests added (191 → ~603 total). The team demonstrated strong parallel execution capabilities, architectural consistency, and business agility through the detection rate discovery. A strategic decision was made to prioritize functional MVP delivery over design polish, with design refinement deferred to post-Epic 6.

**Key Achievement:** Complete single-analysis workflow from creation to real-time ROI calculation, meeting all Epic 2 functional requirements and performance targets.

**Significant Discovery:** Detection rate should be per-analysis (not global) based on real business needs - different failure types have different detectability rates.

---

## Challenges - What Was Difficult

### 1. Parallel Development Coordination ⚠️

**Challenge:**
- Story 2.3 committed inside Story 2.8 commit (agent confusion)
- Non-sequential commit order (2.8, 2.4, 2.2, 2.5 instead of sequential)
- No intermediate checkpoints between story completions

**Stories Affected:**
- All parallel batch stories (2.2-2.5, 2.8)

**Impact:**
- Git log difficult to read
- Story flow unclear
- Potential merge coordination issues

**Root Cause:**
- Prompts not explicit about "ONLY this story, NOT others"
- No verification of first completion before launching remaining windows
- Agents given full autonomy without order constraints

**Resolution:**
- Add to prompts: "Commit ONLY Story X.Y files, verify git diff before commit"
- Check first completion before launching others (for >3 parallel windows)
- Specify commit order explicitly in orchestration prompts

---

### 2. Intermittent Test Failures ⚠️

**Pattern Identified:**
- Some tests fail in full suite but pass in isolation
- Likely cause: race conditions, test order dependencies, or shared state

**Stories Affected:**
- Not specific to one story, observed across Epic 2

**Impact:**
- CI/CD reliability concerns
- Manual re-run needed to confirm real failure vs timing issue

**Resolution:**
- Add explicit `waitFor()` guards in tests with timing dependencies
- Cleanup between tests (Zustand store reset)
- Consider test isolation improvements

---

### 3. Epic 1 Action Items Not Formally Completed ⚠️

**Observation:**
- Accessibility checklist: not created formally (but mindset maintained)
- Tailwind v4 reference doc: not created
- Architecture doc review: done informally, not systematically tracked

**Impact:**
- Action items lose accountability without formal tracking
- Risk of repeating same issues

**Lesson:**
- Action items need explicit owners and verification
- Formal artifacts (checklists, docs) prevent decay
- Follow-through is as important as identification

---

## Key Insights

### 1. MVP-First, Design-Later Strategy ✅

**Context:**
- Initial design feedback: layout too wide, sections need grid 2x3, button FAB
- Team debated: refactor now vs continue features

**Decision:**
- Continue Epic 3-6 with functional design
- Defer design polish to post-Epic 6
- Create design branch after all features complete

**Rationale:**
- Avoid refactoring 6 times (once per epic)
- Validate features with real users first
- Design informed by complete product understanding

**Impact:**
- Faster feature velocity
- Reduced rework risk
- Better design decisions with full context

**Quote:**
> "Il faut qu'on privilégie la fonctionnalité du MVP rapidement. Et ensuite, on fera une branche et une refonte du design quand on aura un truc fonctionnel." - JB

---

### 2. Small Stories = Success ✅

**Evidence:**
- Epic 2 stories were granular and well-defined
- Each story had clear acceptance criteria
- Parallel development was only possible because of small story size

**Impact:**
- Easier to parallelize
- Better quality control
- Reduced risk per story
- More predictable velocity

**Recommendation:**
- Continue fine-grained decomposition for Epic 3
- Accept longer planning time for better execution
- Review story granularity during sprint planning

---

### 3. Business Agility > Perfect Planning ✅

**Evidence:**
- Detection rate discovery mid-Epic 2 (from real business feedback)
- Ability to adapt: create Story 2.9 before Epic 3
- Design strategy pivot based on JB's reflection

**Impact:**
- Product stays aligned with real needs
- Team can respond to discoveries without derailing
- Trust built through transparent discussion

**Lesson:**
- Plan, but stay flexible
- Real user feedback > assumptions
- Retrospectives are decision-making moments, not just reviews

---

### 4. Design Feedback Workflow Critical ✅

**Need Identified:**
- Design improvements accumulating without systematic tracking
- Risk of losing feedback or addressing inconsistently

**Solution:**
- DESIGN_FEEDBACK.md file for centralized tracking
- Update after each retrospective
- Process in batch post-Epic 6

**Impact:**
- No feedback lost
- Clear backlog for design polish
- Team can focus on features without distraction

---

## Significant Discoveries - Epic Update Required?

### Discovery #1: Detection Rate Should Be Per-Analysis

**Context:**
- Discovered 2026-02-09 morning meeting with JB + technical teams
- Different failure types have different detectability rates
- Current implementation: global detection rate (70% for all analyses)

**Business Rationale:**
- Bearing failures: high detectability (~85%) - mechanical, predictable
- Process-induced failures (corrosion, blockage): low detectability (~50%) - chemical, unpredictable
- To provide accurate ROI, each analysis needs its own detection rate

**Technical Impact:**
- Add `detectionRate?: number` to Analysis interface (optional)
- Add detection rate input in InputPanel (default 70%)
- Calculation logic: `analysis.detectionRate ?? globalParams.detectionRate`
- GlobalSidebar: only serviceCostPerPump remains (detection rate removed)

**Epic 3 Impact:**
- Story 3.4 modified: "Global Parameters Adjustment" → "Global Service Cost Adjustment"
- Story 2.9 created: "Detection Rate Per Analysis" (blocker before Epic 3)

**Decision:**
✅ Create Story 2.9 before Epic 3
✅ Modify Story 3.4 scope
✅ GlobalSidebar simplified to single parameter

**Verdict:** Epic 3 plan needs minor update (Story 3.4 scope change)

---

### Discovery #2: Design Refinement Strategy

**Context:**
- JB feedback: layout too wide, scrolling unpleasant, not modern enough
- Team debated: refactor now vs later

**Decision:**
- Defer ALL design polish to post-Epic 6
- Track feedback in DESIGN_FEEDBACK.md
- Create design branch after functional MVP complete

**Impact on Epic 3:**
- No design changes required
- Epic 3 developed with current (functional) design
- Dashboard Grid uses existing patterns

**Verdict:** Epic 3 plan unchanged - proceed as planned

---

## Design Feedback Captured (Deferred to Post-Epic 6)

### Layout & Structure
- Sections InputPanel too wide (50% width unused)
- Grid 2x3 layout would reduce scrolling
- ResultsPanel positioning in new grid layout

### Buttons & Interactions
- "New Analysis" button → FAB (Floating Action Button) rond avec + en bas à gauche
- Modernisation générale - "sortir de l'industrie" aesthetic

### GlobalSidebar
- ~~Sidebar inefficace~~ (RÉSOLU: navigation analyses Epic 3)
- Style modernisation (future)

### Rationale for Deferral
- Refactoring 6 epics incrementally = wasted effort
- Better to validate all features first with real user feedback
- Design branch post-Epic 6 = comprehensive refactor with full context
- MVP velocity prioritized over polish

---

## Conclusion

Epic 2 successfully delivered the Minimum Viable Analysis for ARGOS ROI Calculator V10. The team demonstrated strong execution through parallel development (5 stories simultaneously), architectural consistency (Epic 1 patterns applied successfully), and business agility (detection rate discovery mid-epic).

A strategic decision to defer design polish until post-Epic 6 enables faster feature velocity and better-informed design decisions based on complete product understanding. Story 2.9 (Detection Rate Per Analysis) was identified as a blocker for Epic 3 and will be completed before Epic 3 begins.

**Key Success Factors:**
- Small story decomposition (granular, testable units)
- Test-first mindset maintained (~51.5 tests per story)
- Parallel development with improved discipline (commit order, checkpoints)
- MVP-first strategy (features before polish)
- Business agility (adapt to real user needs)

**Ready for Epic 3:** ✅ After Story 2.9 completion (3-4 hours)

---

**Retrospective Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Document Author:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
**Next Retrospective:** After Epic 3 completion
**Epic 2 Status:** DONE (all 8 stories complete)
**Next Action:** Create and develop Story 2.9 before Epic 3
